# Twitch API

Fulfilling the challenge problem presented earlier to make a Twitch API
using only Vanilla Javascript. This is the first variant. I'll be making another
in Ember as a test project.

## Usage

I've used Plunker instead of Git for what I sent in so it'd be easier to interact
with. Git pages can be a tinge finnicky at times with `base_url`.

Notedly I've added another field for Token, as I'd rather not get blacklisted
from Twitch if that key ends up out in the wild west somewhere. I'll provide you
with a key in a private internal gist for later usage. Message me if you need it.
